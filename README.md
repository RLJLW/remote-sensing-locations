# Remote Sensing Locations

The following are some potentially useful locations for remote sensing

## New York

Notes on seperate polarization data comparing HH, VV, and VH data from UAVSAR processed imagery after processing UAVSAR New York Data from 2022 July 12

Product: newyor_03204_22020_002_220712_L090_CX_129A_020
 
 - NB: using VV factored data we can see material flowing out from the land apparently out of pipes
 - using VV factored data it appears we may be able to see dark patches near boats
 - Flat surfaces parralel to the UAV's flight line can be clearly seen standing out
 - HV polarization (depolarization) is much less pronounced than HH and VV generally over the landscape.
 - Flat fields can seem quite dark in HH, VV, but also in HV, because they don't return significant signal.

## Lake Travis

- Sometimes Island can be seen basically completely submerged in the HH data -  30.399985° -97.892317°
- Hudson Bebnd with the sandy areas appear to be submerged in HH data (around Eagle Ridge, Emerald Point and Hudson Harbor).

## Jamaica (flooded areas) Locations

Hurricane Melissa caused severe flooding to Jamaica, if remote sensing data for these locations could be acquired it may enable better support for the people in the disaster.

At the time of 2025/11/1 I've only been able to find NASA imagery before the disaster, but the following locations are listed for in case further data becomes available.
